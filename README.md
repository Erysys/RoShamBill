# RoShamBill
My final project for iOS Development II at Spokane Community College

This was built over two quarters, and updated from its original version to use CoreData.CoreData is leveraged to store game history, as well as settings. ScrollViews and TableViews are used to make this application functional in portrait and lanscape orientations.
This game is meant to played after enjoying a meal with friends. The goal, however, is not to win. The winner of the game has to cover the entire bill for the meal. The rules are simple. Select a number of players, then have your server take the phone and pick a number between 1 and 1000 (this range can be changed in settings). Then, each player takes turns guessing the number. After each guess, RoShamBill will tell you if you guessed too high, or too low, and will adjust the range of acceptable guesses accordingly. Players continue to take turns until one of them guesses the correct answer.
At the end of the game, the results and turn-by-turn history are saved and can be accessed from the main view by selecting History.
